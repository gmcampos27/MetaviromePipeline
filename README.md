# MetaviromePipeline
This pipeline was developed by the Bioinformatics Lab located in the Blood Center of Ribeir√£o Preto. Our main goal is to classify metagenomics samples. The pipeline provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing and classifying metagenomic data, helping researchers identify and characterize microbial diversity in different types of samples.
